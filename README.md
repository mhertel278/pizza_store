# Pizza Store Sales Dashboard

## Project Aim:
    Build a monthly sales and KPI dashboard for a fictional pizza restaraunt.
    - Sales data are for full year 2015
    - Data stored in four separate CSV files
        orders.csv
        order_details.csv
        pizzas.csv
        pizza_types.csv

    - Tools Used:
        Tableau Public
        Python

## Questions to Answer:
    Find monthly totals for KPIs with percentage change from previous month
        Total Sales Dollars
        Total Units Sold
        Total Orders
    At what times and days are sales the strongest and weakest?
    Which pizza sizes are the strongest and weakest?
    Which pizza types are the strongest and weakest?
    What opportunities are there to capitalize on strong sellers and cut costs on weak sellers?

## Findings:
    Total dollars sold, total orders, and total units sold are all down in December from November
    Total dollars is down more than total units and total orders
        Fewer people are buying high dollar items, and fewer are ordering multiple pizzas on an order
    
    Total dollars are strongest at lunch time hours than dinner hours
    Total dollars are stronger on weekdays than weekends
    Avg units sold per order is highest during lunch time hours
        Recommendation: offer buy-one-get-one 50% off or some similar offer in the evening hours to increase pizzas per order and thus total dollars in evening

    Very few orders are being placed before 11:00 am and after 10:00 pm
        Recommendation: reduce business hours to 11:00 am to 11:00 pm to cut down labor costs during low-sales times
    
    Very few XL or XXL pizzas are being sold
        Recommendation: eliminate  these sizes from the menu, cutting down on inventory costs and inventory spoilage

    Items suc as Bree Carre pizza sell far fewer units than other types in the same category
        Recommendation: eliminate Brie Carre and other pizza types from the menu, cutting costs for specialty ingredients
