# Pizza Store Sales Dashboard

## Project Aim:
    Build a monthly sales and KPI dashboard for a fictional pizza restaraunt.
        Sales data are for full year 2015
        Data stored in four separate CSV files
            orders.csv
            order_details.csv
            pizzas.csv
            pizza_types.csv

        Tools Used:
            Tableau Public
            Python

## Questions to Answer:
    Find monthly totals for KPIs with percentage change from previous month
        Total Sales Dollars
        Total Units Sold
        Total Orders
    At what times and days are sales the strongest and weakest?
    Which pizza sizes are the strongest and weakest?
    Which pizza types are the strongest and weakest?
    What opportunities are there to capitalize on strong sellers and cut costs on weak sellers?

## Findings:
    Total dollars sold, total orders, and total units sold are all down in December from November
    Total dollars is down more than total units and total orders
        Fewer people are buying high dollar items, and fewer are ordering multiple pizzas on an order
    
    Total dollars are strongest at lunch time hours than dinner hours
