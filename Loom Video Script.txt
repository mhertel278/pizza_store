## Intro

Hello, this is Michael Hertel
I are looking at a Dashboard I created to show KPIs for a fictional Pizza store.

## Background
The data for this dashboard comes from Maven Analytics and covers sales for this
	fictonal store for the year 2015 and is organized in 4 csv files
Before building the dashboard I performed some exploraty analysis in Python with Pandas
	and used the analysis there to validate the accuracy of
	the results on the dashboard as I was building it.

## Dashboard Overview-Parameter
The dashboard summarizes the data for one month at a time, and the parameter in the upper right
	allows the user to select which month to view.
	As you can see each KPI card and chart updates when a different month is chosen. For 
	this project analysis I'll look at the data for the most recent month in the data set-December
## KPIs
The KPI Cards show us 
	total sales in USD
	total pizzas ordered
	and total orders
Each card shows the total for the chosen month as Ill as a percentage up or down to the previous month
	and an up or down arrow with conditional formatting, green for up and red for down
I can see that in December all 3 KPIs are down from the previous month, but Dollars are down
	more than the other two values, indicating that I are getting feIr dollars and units per order
So I will look for opportunities to try to improve the dollars and units per sale, 
	But also with sales being down I will look for opportunites to cut unnecessary cost

## HeatMap
Next I will move to the Heatmap to see what days and times sales dollars are the strongest
	The shading is the darkest during lunch time on Weekdays
	and a little less strong at dinner time and on weekends. 
	The tooltips that pop up show that the most orders are being placed during lunch		
	hours, and the avg pizzas per order is higher than during dinner.
### Recommendation
	To boost sales during dinner/weekends I recommend offering a Buy one Get one half off or similar
	promo to increase the dollars/units per order
We see sales and orders are very week before 11 am and after 10 pm,
	So I recommend limiting business hours to 11 am to 10 pm, cutting labor cost during
	the hours that are likely not profitable

## Sizes
Next I'll take a look a the the sales by size chart, which shows that sizes XL and XXL
	sell very few units
	I recommend eliminating those sizes, cutting the cost of having to have dough ready that will then likely spoil
