Tableau Pizza sales Dashboard
Background
	Sales from fictional Pizza Restaraunt for 2015
Questions:
	Are sales $, orders, and units sold UP or Down in current month (Dec) over previous
	When are sales strongest and weakes (days and times)
	Which sizes and types are strongest and weakest
	Any opportunities to capitalize on strengths and eliminate weaknesses
Findings:
	Sales $, orders, units all down in Dec vs Nov
	Sales down most, with units and orders slightly less
		Takeaway-fewer multi pizza orders are being placed, making less effective sales
		
	Sales $ are strongest at lunch time hours, followed by dinner, and stronger on weekdays than weekends
	Avg pizzas per order highest at lunch
		Takeaway-improve order nos and pizzas/order at dinner time to bolster sales
	Sales much lower before 10 and after 10 pm
		Takeaway-open later/closer earlier to avoud overhead at very slow times
	Very few XL or XXL sold
		Drop from menu, as cost of keeping prepared dough for those sizes outweighs occasional sale $
	Items such as Brie Carre sell far fewer units than others in category	
		Drop bottom sellers to eliminate cost of rare ingredients for poor selling items.
	
	Opportunties:
		offer BoGo at dinner time to increase order #s and encourage more units per sale
		Eliminate early and late hours
		Drop Xl and XXl sizes and Brie Carre from menu
